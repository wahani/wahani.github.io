This post explains how to work with lists as objects in
[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) using the R package
[aoos](https://cran.r-project.org/package=aoos). aoos provides alternative
syntax for functions from the built in system for object orientation in the
package *methods*.

The following is a vignette (as iframe) also contained in the package itself.
You can find it by copying the following into R:


{% highlight r %}
install.packages("aoos")
vignette("retListClasses", "aoos")
{% endhighlight %}
