This post introduces the [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) package [aoos](https://cran.r-project.org/package=aoos). aoos provides alternative syntax for functions from the built in system for object orientation in the package *methods*. Its goal is to promote object oriented programming in the R language.

The following is a vignette (as iframe) also contained in the package itself. You can find it if you copy the following into R:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("aoos")
vignette("Introduction", "aoos")
```
